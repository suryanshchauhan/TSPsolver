# TSPsolver

<h3>Description:</h3>
The Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) is a famous problem in Computer Science, both because it is a very hard problem to solve (one of a class called NP-complete), and because there are many approximation algorithms to find a decent solution to it. TSP can be quickly summarized by assuming that there are N cities, with a cost of travel from every city to every other city defined. TSP asks us to find the lowest cost path from a given city back to that city that passes through every other city once and only once.
One way of obtaining a solution to a TSP problem is to use a genetic algorithm. I have implemented a genetic algorithm to find a solution to TSP problems.


<h3>The Program:</h3>
When the program is run, it does the following:
<li> Prompts the user to enter a file name. </li>
<li> Opens the file and read in the information about the TSP. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it prints an appropriate error message and exits the program. If it does, it prints the information from the file (the list of names and grid of costs). </li> 
<li> Runs a genetic algorithm to find the best path for the TSP. While running, the program prints the cost of the best tour it has found during each generation.</li>
<li> When the program is finished, it prints the best path found, and the resulting path cost. </li>

<h3>File Format:</h3>
<li> The first line of the file is an integer N. This number is the number of cities in the problem.</li>
<li> The next N lines will each contain one string, representing the name of the city. You can assume that this name will contain no spaces. The name on the i-th line is the name of the i- th city. </li>
<li> The next N lines will each contain N integers. This will create an N x N grid which gives the costs to travel between cities. In particular, the number in the j-th column of the i-th row is the cost to travel from city i to city j. You cannot assume that the cost from i to j will be the same as the cost from j to i. The element in the i-th row and i-th column should be 0. </li>
