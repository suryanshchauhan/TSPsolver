<h3>Description:</h3>
The Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) is a famous problem in Computer Science, both because it is a very hard problem to solve (one of a class called NP-complete), and because there are many approximation algorithms to find a decent solution to it. TSP can be quickly summarized by assuming that there are N cities, with a cost of travel from every city to every other city defined. TSP asks us to find the lowest cost path from a given city back to that city that passes through every other city once and only once.
One way of obtaining a solution to a TSP problem is to use a genetic algorithm. I have implemented a genetic algorithm to find a solution to TSP problems.
